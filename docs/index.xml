      <description>Networking vendors like Cisco, Arista , Juniper have developped their own operating system and all networking engineers had to learn them in order to be relevant when designing, implementing or supporting their own network.&#xA;Each of these operating systems has its unique features and capabilities, and they are used in different network environments and for different purposes. Some are more suitable for small-scale networks, while others are designed for large-scale enterprise networks.</description>

AWS and Google Cloud call it a VPC, while Azure for example calls it a VNET (virtual network).&#xA;Network constructs are different between cloud providers.</description>

      <description>In a previous blogpost we managed to manually create a simple VPC that could host several services or traditionnal EC2 instances. This process was quite simple using the AWS console as it would deploy all the network construct within a VPC (Subnets, Route Tables, Internet Gateways etc...)&#xA;I have been deploying network infrastructure (NSX, Cumulus, Cisco ...) for the past few years using Infrastructure as Code and naturally I will show you how to deploy networking cloud constructs related to AWS (not only !</description>
