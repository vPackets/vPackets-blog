      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was labbing back in the days on GNS3, all I needed to test my routing was another router. That networking device sole purpose was to ping accross the network. I just had to create a default route pointing to the upstream router and I could ping (if my lab was working.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/containerlab/linux/gns3-lab.png&#34; alt=&#34;GNS Lab&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nowadays and with infrastructure as code, I don&#39;t want to spend time configuring IP addresses on routers and preserve as much resources as I can.&#xA;I have decided to use 2 containers that will be configured with the same IP addresses for every single lab: 192.0.2.100/24 and 203.0.113.100 .&lt;/p&gt;</description>
